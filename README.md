Investment portfolios, central to finance, balance potential returns and risks. This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Markowitz's Portfolio Theory with deep learning, utilizing knowledge distillation for training agents. These agents, once trained, optimize portfolio assembly. A comparative analysis against standard financial models and AI frameworks, using metrics like returns, the Sharpe ratio, and nine evaluation indices, reveals our model's superiority. It notably achieves the highest yield and Sharpe ratio of 2.03, ensuring top profitability with the lowest risk in comparable return scenarios.
